###6.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement of the complete data set
###7.Update the complete data set with only selected measurements.
###8.Converts all the activity  and  subject  columns into factors
###9.Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

###The end result is shown in the file  tidyData.txt in the working directory.
